### Project Planning
 
Motivation for project:
The motivation for this project is to address how the real estate market has correlated with crime rates pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Description of the issues or opportunities the project will address:
 
New York City is among the most expensive and competitive housing markets in the nation.
 
This Data Warehouse will address how the real estate market has correlated with crime rates pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that during COVID-19, real estate prices have dropped and crime rates have spiked.
Thus, this Data Warehousing project will analyze how COVID-19 has changed market outlook
